Article 15: Title: Requesting Data Export or Deletion Content: Customers can request a full export of their data by contacting support, citing their intent. For account and data deletion, they must formally confirm this action, as it is irreversible. The request is then escalated to the Data Privacy team for handling within the legal timeframe.
