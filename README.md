# Company Ticket Auto Responder (RAG)

⚠️ **Work in Progress**  

This repository contains the backend scripts for an AI powered ticket auto responder using retrieval augmented generation (RAG) with a knowledge base.

**Note:** The README and documentation will be updated after fine tuning, testing, and full integration.  

## Current Status
- Backend Python scripts ready
- Knowledge base articles embedded in ChromaDB
- RAG based reply generation functional
- Classification and retrieval pipelines in place

## Next Steps
- Fine tune the model
- Add front end integration or API endpoints
- Improve retrieval accuracy and handling of out of scope queries
- Expand KB articles

## Note
This project is intended for learning purposes, exploring the use of LLMs for internal support tools, and is part of my personal portfolio. It demonstrates retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and knowledge base embeddings with ChromaDB. Not production ready.
